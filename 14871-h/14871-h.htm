<td>he Poems contained in this booklet composed when ill, and either blind or
nearly so, are given to the public for the purpose of strengthening faith
in God. Those outlining in part, a life that has been more than filled by
the disciplinarian, sorrow, are but a glimpse of the many heavy crosses
borne. In my retrospection I can only believe the Father deemed me worthy
to be tested, at the same time giving wonderful revelations of Himself and
many answers to prayer. Thanks be to Him, that I was brought through the
fire with unshaken faith in Christ, for this end, to prove that those who
stand firm in faith will not only be given a victory, but be brought to a
greater joy and fellowship with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.<br />

With bleeding hearts, unpardoned sin,<br />
A Cross with pearls, and gems inlaid,<br />
God's gift of love, the price prepaid.<br /><br />

These precious pearls were once a tear,<br />
Repentant sighs, a hope, a fear,<br />
But rough seas washed and jewels grew<br />
Until the Cross was pearly hue.<br /><br />

Unnumbered are the pearls and fair,<br />
If burdens of the weary share;<br />
And deeply wrought with threads of gold,<br />
If smiles of peace suppress our woe.<br /><br />

To help Thee, Christ, in saving world,<br />
Forgetting self is rarest pearl,<br />
That brightly glows when righting wrong,<br />
Assisting souls in Thee grow strong.<br /><br />

Is covered o'er with pearls of prayer;<br />
On Cross of Love all hopes are stayed,<br />
Each time it's kissed a pearl's inlaid.<br /><br />

<td>he terrors of night have fallen on me,<br />
The shadow of forms no longer I see,<br />
Eyes that have lingered on objects of light<br />
Are now ever closed by day and by night;<br />
As time passes on I shed bitter tears,<br />
Wearily waiting these many long years,<br />
Oftentimes waking from dreaming to find<br />
Nothing but gloom&mdash;I am helpless and blind.<br /><br />

Of all earthly joys I am nearly bereft,<br />
No pleasure of friends, alone I am left,<br />
Kind hearts there are some, though many, alas!<br />
Send a curious gaze toward me as they pass;<br />
One visitor daily&mdash;a small ray of sun<br />
Just crossing my face, it gladly doth run&mdash;<br />
Bringing me news of the weather and time,<br />
And memories sweet of my own sunny clime.<br /><br />

They've taken my children away from their home,<br />
For care, to them mother love is unknown;<br />
Their smiles and caresses to strangers are given,<br />
Alone, in despair, my fond heart is riven;<br />
O! tell me, kind angels, shall I ever recover<br />
To care for my children and heart-broken mother?<br />
While sadly I'm thinking of joys that have passed,<br />
For days like my childhood, in mercy I ask.<br /><br />

How strange seems the quiet, how foreign to one<br />
Who reveled in beauty, in pleasure, and fun;<br />
As healthy and happy and merry as May,<br />
School-books in hand, I would hasten away.<br />
But, listen! What noises are those that I hear?<br />
In the silence strange fancies awaken my fear,<br />
And terrible phantoms of lunatics try<br />
To glare o'er my couch and stifle my cry.<br /><br />

Welcome, O! Death, do not leave me alone,<br />
The future's unkind and hopes are all flown;<br />
In pain and in anguish my sorrow untold;<br />
In age most a child, yet in trouble grown old.<br />
But God in His mercy one bright hope has given&mdash;<br />
Saviour to love and rest in dear Heaven;<br />
There beautiful music and many things fair,<br />
While voices of loved ones with song fill the air.<br /><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bereft of thy sight,</span><br />
And dark lines of sorrow and trials surround thee<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By day and by night.</span><br /><br />

To-day I am sitting so dreary and lonely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Heart-sick and in pain,</span><br />
And wishing 'twere Heaven's will I could only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Once see thee again.</span><br /><br />

If so, I could bear all the pain and the sorrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of life and its cares,</span><br />
And not fill the hours of the coming to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With sighs and with tears.</span><br /><br />

Like you, many hopes of the future I cherished<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When free from life's care,</span><br />
Just so, all my brightest fond visions have perished<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like mists in the air.</span><br /><br />

I still hope that God in His merciful kindness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy sight will restore,</span><br />
And permit thee when perfectly healed of thy blindness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To see us once more.</span><br /><br />

But restore thee or not, one hope I will cherish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">At home and abroad,</span><br />
That I may submit to my fate, though I perish,<br />

Together they a photograph of mother earth would make,<br />
When midnight dropped her curtains low and watching stars locked gate.<br /><br />

I'll picture on thy pale round face an image vast, complete,<br />
Of pondrous size with oceans wild and mountains high and steep,<br />
A hurling mass of seething lakes, while outward beauties fold<br />
It round and o'er with nature's green, and tinted crusts of gold.<br /><br />

Quite pleased with thought fair lady moon laughed in merry glee,<br />
And begged the secret not reveal but plan all quietly;<br />
Appointing hour and length of time, arranging for the place,<br />
Then hiding lights at midnight bells, when earth passed o'er her face.<br /><br />

While swinging to a silvered chord attached to heaven's dome,<br />
To and fro 'mid seas of stars and spirit worlds unknown,<br />
Earth onward swept with mighty bounds, measured space, and soon<br />
At place appointed and the hour she hovered near the moon.<br /><br />

But scheming of the comrades bright to her had been revealed,<br />
With telescopes and lenses strong, were millions on the field<br />
Of spots and specks as showered sand, by fays called wo and man,<br />
Who gazed with awe at wondrous sight, earth pictured in moonland.<br /><br />

Inspiring vision piled on high in masses huge and dense;<br />
Where camest thou? thou ragged ball thrown out from time, and whence<br />
Doth thou intend to fathom realms of endless space and years?<br />
Art weary of thy dizzy flights? Are rolling seas thy tears?<br /><br />

The silence mocks the questions sighed, and nought but shadows fall;<br />
The picture made the fairies fade, with dying notes they call.<br />
Doth see the Hand that holds the key? Eclipse of moon they sing,<br />
Go, nations, to thy dreamland couch, and ponder o'er this thing.<br /><br />

Through wakeful hours I scan each page penned in despair and grief,<br />
Then turn to my loved childhood's home for comfort and relief.<br /><br />

A cottage white was standing there among the grand old hills.<br />
And 'midst the spreading shady trees were songs of laughing rills.<br />
In that dear home my parents lived, my brothers large and small,<br />
With uncles, aunts and cousins near, and I the pet of all.<br /><br />

But listen! 'tis my childrens' call, I hear their plaintive prayer,<br />
In fancy now I press soft cheeks and fondly stroke fair hair.<br />
Wide seas may roll between us, yet my darlings will life brave,<br />

<td>he battle-cry is sounding loud, a bugle calls to arm,<br />
The hills and dales are clouded o'er, troops gather in alarm;<br />
With winds is mingled sighing prayer from many a sinking brave;<br />
A youth obeying duty's call, a life his country gave.<br /><br />

A soldier boy's dying cry is heard amid the roar<br />
Of battle strife; surround with slain he falls to rise no more.<br />
Some mother's boy! it matters not if clad in blue or gray,<br />
If fighting for the right or wrong, is hurried to his grave.<br /><br />

Amid the beats of drum and fife, his pillow but a sod,<br />
With folded hands and marble brow, his soul returns to God.<br />
Some mother's boy is resting where the lonely willows weep,<br />
And voices waft with waving trees, while angels watch him sleep.<br /><br />

Now comes along the highway a dusty tramp forlorn,<br />
A tattered coat conceals beneath a bent and aged form,<br />
With hardened weary visage, a bell he faintly rings;<br />
The air is rent with pitying notes, an angel softly sings.<br /><br />

Upon this frozen nature no love for years has shown;<br />
His life is made of cruel words, and knows no kindly tone;<br />
And could you see into his past, as mother clasped her boy,<br />
He then was innocent and fair&mdash;her pride, her hope, her joy.<br /><br />

She never dreamed her darling child a weary tramp would be,<br />
For o'er his tasks or youthful sports he laughed in childish glee;<br />
Perhaps he sinned, but, O! forget, for suffering must repay,<br />
And someone's boy has now become wretched, old and gray.<br /><br />

Within a large and gilded hall a revel wild is held,<br />
The sound of oaths and laughter loud upon the breezes swell;<br />
A man is seen with bloated face come reeling to the streets;<br />
He turns his fierce and lurid eyes as friends he loudly greets.<br /><br />

Some mother's boy has fallen low, we hear the broken sob<br />
Of angels who have watched for years his footsteps turn from God.<br />
Someone's prayers have oft been made o'er him in childhood's day,<br />
When, rocked in love, he knew no wrong, a smiling infant lay.<br /><br />

Some mother's tears have freely flowed, and lonely vigils kept;<br />
Some mother's heart has often bled while others coldly slept;<br />
Some mother suffers for the wrong, and angels sadly weep<br />
Whene'er some careless, wayward son has sown what he must reap.<br /><br />

A scaffold high with spreading arms on yonder height we see,<br />
It waits to take its victim's life, exulting cruelly.<br />
While zephyr's blow, birds hover o'er a soul in dire distress,<br />
With troubled gaze breathes out a prayer. Will God attend and bless?<br /><br />

What matter if he's clothed in sin, what matter if he's wild,<br />
In foulest guilt? Remember, that, he is somebody's child.<br />
We cannot tell how hard he strove to shun temptation's snare;<br />
How often on his mother's breast he wept in his despair.<br /><br />

How oft her lips had softly pressed his dimpled infant cheek,<br />
How oft her hand in love caressed the sinless baby feet.<br />
Then, strangers, pause and listen well; so might your own have been,<br />
But Christ can freely pardon all, though scarlet be his sin.<br /><br />


Some mother's boy! The sweet refrain is breathed in accents mild.<br />
Some mother's boy! If bent and gray, if pure or all denied.<br />
Some mother's boy! Soft bells repeat in sad and sweetest chime;<br />
Some mother's boy! A mother sighs; perhaps he may be mine.<br /><br />

Dear Master, sore trials beset me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My feet slipping oft' by the way,</span><br />
Temptations and doubt, overwhelming,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Thee, led me often astray.</span><br />
My cross was oft' covered with roses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Just hiding the sly, cruel thorn,</span><br />
My homestead built out of dust only,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has crumbled; to-day I am born.</span><br /><br />

Just born in the light of thy kingdom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hast house in thy domain to give?</span><br />
A homestead to fill with the loved ones,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where with Thee in peace we may live.</span><br />
I know that my spirit is earth-stained,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I'd wash it in yon flowing stream,</span><br />
I've come, oh my Saviour, all broken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are hopes to be only a dream?</span><br /><br />

He turned with a look of compassion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His voice, as sweet waters and low,</span><br />
My child, I've a palace built for thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which time nor rude winds can o'erthrow.</span><br />
I've watched thee in all of thy wanderings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">E'en when thy homestead of clay fell;</span><br />
I list for thy knock at our portals,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heard thee faintly ask, &quot;Is all well?&quot;</span><br /><br />

When doubts have assailed, I would press thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In sorrow, stood oft' by thy side;</span><br />
I've quelled maddened waves as they dashed thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Soul, ring heaven's bells and abide.</span><br />
Thy footsteps shall fall in soft places,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by mirrored waters can'st roam;</span><br />
Thy kindred, thy Father, shall greet thee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To peace, beauty, love,&mdash;welcome home.</span><br /><br />

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
